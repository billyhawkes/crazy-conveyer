# Crazy Conveyor

## Game loop

1. Your item does its loops
2. You use that money to upgrade tracks
3. Once fully upgraded you can prestige

## Upgrades
Done by pressing on a track

### Track
- Speed
- Value

### Unlocking more tracks
Start with one tracks and unlock more

### Global
- Total items (1 -> 1 per track)
- Track speed
- Loop bonus

### Tasks
- [x] Max levels
- [x] Min speed should be 0.1
- [x] UI
- [x] Improve art
- [x] Main menu
- [x] Saving state
- [x] Prevent overlapping items (even on save)

- [x] Balancing
- [x] Prestiging (after 6 items)

- [x] Music
- [x] Make music slightly faster based on global speed
- [x] Fix random text in top left
- [x] Sound effects
- [x] Icon
- [x] Mute music/sounds buttons
- [x] Store page
- [x] Play testing
- [x] Make easier at start, improve exponentials
- [x] Bonus marker

### Balancing
- Everything should exponential even a little (slow down in end), allows prestiging to be worth it
- Global upgrades should be more exponential
- Speed should be more exponenetial than value

Long run
- Global are too slow (shorten first new item loop, loop/speed too much)
